If any students have made software testing-related contributions outside of coursework during this semester — including but not limited to submitting PRs to fix bugs, adding tests, or reporting vulnerabilities — you may submit a detailed report documenting the process and results. We will evaluate the contribution based on project importance/popularity and issue severity and grant bonus points to the final semester grade accordingly.

Notes:
Only contributions made this semester (2025/09/01–2025/12/18) will be considered.
Contributions must be software testing-related, as defined above. If unsure, you may choose to document everything in the report, and the TAs will assess the relevance of each contribution. Alternatively, you may consult the TAs in advance for clarification.
