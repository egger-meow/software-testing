Download and install the JavaScript mutation tool: StrykerJS. Use it to test calculator.js. Design tests and try to kill mutants as many as possible.

You can get template here: https://github.com/SQLab/114-fall-software-testing/tree/main/hw4

Eventually, please answer questions below and write a PDF file to submit your answers.

(a) How many mutants are there in total? (10%)

(b) What mutation score were you able to achieve in Lab1’s test suite? (5%) You don’t need to reimplement your test in lab1. It’s okay to just paste screenshot of StrykerJS's result.

(c) How do you kill those mutants? (please paste all of your test code here) (30%)

(d) What mutation score were you able to achieve? (40%) Please paste screenshot of StrykerJS's result, for example:

(e) Can your test achieve 100% mutation score? Why not if you can't? (20%)

Note:

The score of (d) will be calculated by following formula:

highest score in the class = H

lowest score in the class = L

your score = S

(d)'s final score = 40*(S-L)/(H-L)
